Phases of a React component's lifecycle
A React component undergoes three phases in its lifecycle: mounting, updating, and unmounting.

1>The mounting phase is when a new component is created and inserted into the DOM or, in other words, when the life of a component begins. This can only happen once, and is often called “initial render.”

2>The updating phase is when the component updates or re-renders. This reaction is triggered when the props are updated or when the state is updated. This phase can occur multiple times, which is kind of the point of React.

3>The last phase within a component's lifecycle is the unmounting phase, when the component is removed from the DOM.
